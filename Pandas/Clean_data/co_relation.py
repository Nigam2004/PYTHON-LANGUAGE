# he corr() method calculates the relationship between each column in your data set.

# out-put:-
#           Duration     Pulse  Maxpulse  Calories
# Duration  1.000000 -0.155408  0.009403  0.922721
# Pulse    -0.155408  1.000000  0.786535  0.025120
# Maxpulse  0.009403  0.786535  1.000000  0.203814
# Calories  0.922721  0.025120  0.203814  1.000000

# The Result of the corr() method is a table with a lot of numbers that represents how well the relationship is between two columns.
# The number varies from -1 to 1.
# 1 means that there is a 1 to 1 relationship (a perfect correlation), and for this data set, each time a value went up in the first column, the other one went up as well.
# 0.9 is also a good relationship, and if you increase one value, the other will probably increase as well.
# -0.9 would be just as good relationship as 0.9, but if you increase one value, the other will probably go down.
# 0.2 means NOT a good relationship, meaning that if one value goes up does not mean that the other will.
